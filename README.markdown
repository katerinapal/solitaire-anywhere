Solitaire Anywhere
==================

I wrote this JavaScript game in 2003 while working as a QA intern at Unisys. The idea was to create a game that could be played from any computer.

Enjoy the table-based layout, hilarious version history, and above all, the "DHTML."

It sort of runs on modern browsers.
