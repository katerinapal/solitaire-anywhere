<b>12.22.03</b>
<br>
:: Added help for Freecell and a test sound. The sound will play when a card automatically moves.

<br><br>
<b>12.18.03</b>
<br>
:: New buttons!

<br><br>
<b>12.16.03</b>
<br>
:: Added help for klondike. Freecell help is coming soon.

<br><br>
<b>12.15.03</b>
<br>
:: Added an animation option for auto moving which includes double clicking, space bar, and freecell's auto move.

<br><br>
<b>12.08.03</b>
<br>
:: By request I changed the dragging function to position the cards based on their vertical center, not the mouse position.
 I also added a pause feature to freecell.

<br><br>
<b>12.05.03</b>
<br>
:: Fixed bugs and added the undo to freecell. Also added a checkbox for automatically sending cards to the foundations.

<br><br>
<b>12.03.03</b>
<br>
:: Freecell! I've finished a rough version of Freecell that you can access through the solitaire link.
 I've also moved many of the functions to separate js files for reuse. Try it out and have fun.

<br><br>
<b>12.02.03</b>
<br>
:: Added a cool new feature. Press the space bar and every card that is on the table that can be moved
to an ace pile will do so. This should make the end of each game a little nicer. Take that Microsoft Freecell.

<br><br>
<b>11.25.03</b>
<br>
:: Undo! I wish life had undos. Like if you fell down the stairs you could just
hit ctrl-z and you would be at the top of the stairs again. Anyways, solitaire now has
an undo feature. But only one undo. Because one of my co-workers was threatening to start calling
it "cheater solitaire."

<br><br>
<b>11.17.03</b>
<br>
:: Minor bug fixes today. One last big bug (that I know of): when your browser window is not maximized, try dragging a card of the edge of the window quickly. The card gets stuck. If anyone knows of a good way to fix this out-of-bounds problem please let me know.

<br><br>
<b>11.14.03</b>
<br>
:: Beta Release! Today my solitaire game (Klondike) is officially linked to this site. I hope to get all the bugs out soon.
I think I'll start working on Free Cell next.

<br><br>
<b>11.13.03</b>
<br>
:: The Beta version of DHTML solitaire is almost done. I just need to make new card graphics. There are also a few known bugs. Please try out the game and let me know what you think.
